# RN_Authentication
Using Firebase this app authenticates a username and password combination to validate the credentials.  If successful it logs the user into the app.  If not successful it tries to create a new account with the email and password combination.  If still not successful it will show an error to the user meaning an account already exists with that email address and the password supplied doesn't match.
